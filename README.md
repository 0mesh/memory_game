# Memory Game
A grid-based game made with Reactjs 

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. On the game board there are always 2 cards with same color. 


## How to play Memory Game
- Start the game by flipping a card.
- Then try to find another card that has the same color as the first.
- If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. 
- Try to remember the color on the card as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.
- When you find a pair they are kept visible on the board.
- When you find all the pairs in this memory you have completed the level.
